<h1 style="color:#6C5B7B; text-decoration:underline;">Low Float Stock Criteria</h1>

<h2 style="color:#C06C84;">Overview</h2>

<p style="color:#3E606F;">Low float stocks are those with a relatively small number of shares available for trading. These types of stocks can be attractive to traders because they are often more volatile and can experience large price movements in a short amount of time.</p>

<h2 style="color:#C06C84;">Criteria</h2>

<ul style="color:#3E606F;">
  <li><strong>Float:</strong> The float is the number of shares available for regular traders to buy and sell. A low float stock will have a relatively small float compared to its outstanding shares.</li>
  <li><strong>Outstanding Shares:</strong> The number of outstanding shares is the total number of shares that a company has issued. A low float stock will have a relatively small number of outstanding shares compared to more established companies.</li>
  <li><strong>Market Capitalization:</strong> Low float stocks generally have a market capitalization between $50 million and $500 million.</li>
  <li><strong>Price:</strong> Low float stocks can have a wide range of prices, but generally trade between $1 and $10.</li>
  <li><strong>Volume:</strong> Low float stocks should have a high trading volume, ideally at least 5 times the average volume for that stock.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="color:#C06C84;">Memory Tools</h2>

<ul style="color:#3E606F;">
  <li>Remember the acronym F.O.M.P.V.: Float, Outstanding Shares, Market Cap, Price, Volume.</li>
  <li>Think of low float stocks as a small boat in a big ocean, where the waves are large and choppy.</li>
  <li>Visualize a low float stock as a hot air balloon, where a small amount of buying pressure can cause a large price movement.</li>
</ul>
